            There is a lot to say about you. There would always be a lot
             But I'll attempt to use a few words. Thankyou Muizat for being you
            For being your joyful self. For standing firm despite the challenges life throws as you.
            You are amazing. You are great- you'll always be. Never forget that. 
            Happy birthday once again my love!</div>
